Hey there!
My name is Josh, but in the Information Security space I'm better known as "0ldMate". I've been passionate about computer security for several years. A huge benefit in my journey was being able to interact with and ask people questions within the community itself. I'm now fortunate enough to be in a position to give back.

I'm planning on self-funding this venture to seek out blood, plasma, and platelet donations from the general public. Depending on how that goes, who knows? Maybe we'll expand into something new in the future!
If you have any questions reach out to me at my email blooddrive@0ldmate.com or on twitter at @0ldMate_

Thanks for your time,

Josh
