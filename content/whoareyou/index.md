My name is Josh, however I often go by the name 0ldMate and I work as a pentester based in Sydney. I've been in the security community for a few years now and have soaked up so much knowledge from peers through different community meetups and conferences. I'm now fortunately in a position where I can give back.

I've been passionate about donating blood for a few years now and have been donating plasma regularly every 2 weeks since. I think it's super important and hope to encourage more to donate when possible, as you never know when you might be on the receiving end. I'd like to think with the incentive of a month subscription, it will encourage some hackers be it old or new to donate blood.

This is something I've been thinking about for a while and have no idea how it will be taken. I'm planning on self funding this venture for the forseeable future and have plans to hopefully expand into offering more than just subscriptions depending on how it pans out.

If you've got any questions feel free to reach out.

Thanks for your time!

See you in the chair,

0ldMate
