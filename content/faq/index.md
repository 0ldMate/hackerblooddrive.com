1. **Why should I donate?**
[HERE](https://www.donateblood.com.au/learn) is a brief page with information about donating and why it's so important.
2. **What do I get for donating?**
You get to chose between a Pentester Lab subscription or a Hack The Box subscription.
3. **What country can I donate from?**
At the moment, this is only within Australia.
4. **Can I donate plasma 2 times a month and therefore consistently have both subscriptions free?**
You definitely could, however, depending on my funds, I may need to limit you to only one even with 2 donations a month. 
5. **I've submitted to the form and haven't heard back from you, what can I do?**
It's possible I've not checked it yet, please give me a few days to respond, if you haven't heard in 3 days shoot me a DM on twitter and I'll make sure to get back to you.
6. **Why are you collecting information like age and gender?**
These fields are completely optional, it just allows me to hopefully build some cool graphs to visually see what groups of people are donating. If you don't feel comfortable filling out these forms, that's completely fine.
7. **Why are you doing this?**
This community has given me a lot, I want to give back.
8. **I have X condition, can I donate?**
I'm not an employee of Lifeblood, however you can check your eligibility easily using this [QUIZ](https://www.donateblood.com.au/eligibility)
