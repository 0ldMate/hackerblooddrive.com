Hacker Blood Drive was created to incentivise security professionals or people who are wanting to get into the information security field to donate blood. In Australia a blood donation is needed **every** **24 seconds**. The incentive being a one-month subscription to either Pentester Labs or Hack The Box. Both of these resources are amazing and provide a huge amount of potential knowledge within their programs. We believe they are both valueable resources for all security professionals no matter your experience.

**How do I get my free stuff?**

All you need to do is book in to your local [Australian Red Cross Lifeblood centre](https://www.donateblood.com.au/) and donate either whole blood, plasma or platelets. Once you've donated, go ahead and snap a picture of the Lifeblood sign in the centre with a piece of paper with your twitter handle or email address, upload it to imgur, and fill out our google form.

**What do we get out of it?**

Nothing. I'm doing this as a way to give back to the community in a way that also benefits others. The Australian hacker community has given me so much, and now I'm in a position to give back.
